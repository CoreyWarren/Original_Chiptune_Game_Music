# Original_Chiptune_Game_Music

Collection of my original game music. Most of it will be meant for my "With Spirit!" game project, which is also a repository I am maintaining.

### Upcoming feature:

Automation of conversion from .ftm to 1) .wav and 2) .txt for publishing here.

#### Why?

So I don't have to convert the files myself every time I update my music. Also whenever I do update my music, I can easily drag+drop my new files here in bulk without having to manually convert each file by hand.
